# Emu6502
A simple 6502 machine code styled interpreter. I might turn it into it's own scripting language in the future, who knows.
## Program setup
Make a .sfot file with a size of 0x10000 (65536) bytes, write your code to it with a hex editor of some kind, and you've got a script. This is essentially just a map of memory that the interpreter takes in as input.
