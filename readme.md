# Emu6502
A simple 6502 machine code styled interpreter. Originally started the project as an emulator, but figured it would be fun to make a scripting language out of it instead. 
## Program setup
Make a .sfot file with a size of 0x10000 (65536) bytes, write your hex code to it, and you've got a script. This is essentially just a map of memory that the program takes in as input.
